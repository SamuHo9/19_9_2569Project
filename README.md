# Hippocampal Shape Analysis for Epilepsy Detection

Updated reliability workflow: see [IMPROVEMENTS_TH.md](IMPROVEMENTS_TH.md) for the fixes, verification results, training-reference migration, and remaining validation work. New training runs use a common original-subject split and write to `Model/validated_runs/`. Historical results and Desktop weights have not been replaced.

A comprehensive, end-to-end medical imaging pipeline for the automated extraction, 3D shape parameterization, statistical morphological analysis, and machine-learning-based classification of the hippocampus from structural MRI scans. 

This project aims to detect and lateralize **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)** by identifying subtle morphometric (shape) changes and atrophy patterns in the hippocampus that are often invisible to the naked eye but statistically significant across populations.

## ⚙️ Detailed Pipeline Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing & Segmentation (`run_pipeline.py`)
The pipeline begins with raw patient MRI scans.
1. **Automated Segmentation (FastSurfer):** Raw T1-weighted `.nii.gz` files are fed into FastSurferCNN. It utilizes a deep learning network to rapidly segment the entire brain into standard anatomical labels (DKT Atlas) in under a minute per subject.
2. **Hippocampus Extraction (`extract_hippocampus.py`):** The pipeline isolates Label `17` (Left Hippocampus) and Label `53` (Right Hippocampus).
3. **Morphological Cleaning:** Extracted regions undergo a 3D binary closing operation (mathematical morphology) to fill internal holes and smooth rough boundaries caused by voxelization.
4. **Organized Output:** Masks are saved neatly into `left_hippocampus` and `right_hippocampus` folders, ready for shape analysis.

### Phase 2: Shape Analysis via SlicerSALT (`run_everything.bat`)
This phase relies on the **SlicerSALT** (Shape Analysis Toolbox) environment to perform robust geometric operations.

#### Step 2.1: Group-wise ICP Alignment (`ICP/ICP.py`)
* **Problem:** Patients' heads are scanned at different angles and positions in the MRI machine.
* **Solution:** The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm aligns all hippocampal masks in the dataset into a common, normalized physical coordinate space.
* **Mechanism:** It uses a group-wise approach. It repeatedly aligns all subjects to a continuously updating "mean shape" (average template) until convergence is reached. It also checks for "pole flips" (ensuring the head and tail of the hippocampus point in the correct direction).

#### Step 2.2: SPHARM-PDM Parameterization (`SPHARM/run_spharm_batch.py`)
* **Problem:** Voxel-based masks cannot be compared point-by-point across different subjects because they have different surface topographies.
* **Solution:** Spherical Harmonics Point Distribution Models (SPHARM-PDM).
* **Mechanism:** The voxel masks are mapped onto a sphere and parameterized using spherical harmonic basis functions (similar to a Fourier transform, but for 3D surfaces). This generates a uniform 3D triangular mesh (VTK file) for every subject where Vertex `N` on Patient A corresponds exactly to the anatomical location of Vertex `N` on Patient B.

#### Step 2.3: Anatomical Re-alignment (`SPHARM/realign_spharm.py`)
Even after ICP and SPHARM, meshes might have rotational phase shifts along the spherical parameterization. This script enforces strict anatomical alignment (anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, medial-lateral) using geometric landmarks (e.g., finding the furthest vertex to define the "tail").

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis & Visualization (`Visualize/`)
* **PLS-DA (`visualize_plsda.py`):** Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis is applied to the high-dimensional vertex data. It identifies the specific directions of shape variance that maximize the separation between healthy controls and epilepsy patients. 
* **3D Visualizations:** Includes Python scripts using `pyvista` and `vtk` to render the 3D average shapes and overlay color maps showing areas of significant inward/outward deformation (atrophy/hypertrophy) associated with the disease.

### Phase 4: Data Augmentation & Machine Learning (`Data_Processing/` & `Model/`)
* **Feature Extraction (`extract_ml_features.py`):** Converts the complex 3D SPHARM VTK coordinates and SPHARM coefficients into structured 1D CSV vectors suitable for standard machine learning classifiers.
* **Data Augmentation (`augment_plsda_interpolation.py`):** Medical datasets are often small. This script utilizes the latent space generated by PLS-DA to interpolate and generate *synthetic yet anatomically realistic* hippocampus shapes to balance the dataset and prevent ML overfitting.
* **Model Training & Cross-Dataset Validation:** Trains classical ML models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify the disease. It strongly emphasizes robustness by training on one dataset (e.g., `Ds005602`) and validating on a completely unseen dataset (e.g., `Ds004469`).
* **Statistical Reporting (`generate_report.py`):** Automatically compiles performance metrics, ROC curves, and P-value summaries into professional PDF reports (`Model_Test_Report.pdf`).

  - One-click dataset selection and execution.
  - Interactive parameter tuning (e.g., adjusting ICP iterations, SPHARM degrees).
  - Integrated 3D mesh viewer directly inside the application window.
  - Real-time logging console to track pipeline progress.
- **Execution:** Simply run `python DesktopApp/main.py`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started & Execution

### Prerequisites
- **OS:** Windows (Pipeline heavily utilizes `.bat` scripts and Powershell)
- **Python:** Python 3.10+ (required by the bundled FastSurfer); use a separate environment for the Desktop/training tools and SlicerSALT's own interpreter for its CLI modules.
- **Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (includes `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `vtk`, `matplotlib`, `pyvista`, `scikit-learn`, `PyQt5`)
- **External Software:** 
  - **SlicerSALT (v6.0+):** Must be installed and configured in `run_everything.bat` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\SlicerSALT 6.0.0\SlicerSALT.exe`).
  - **FastSurfer:** Must be cloned and checkpoints downloaded. Update the path in `config.py`.

### Running the Full Pipeline

**Step 1: Extract Hippocampus from MRI**
```bash
python run_pipeline.py --input_dir /path/to/raw/mri/
```
*Output will be organized into `/output/left_hippocampus` and `/output/right_hippocampus`.*

**Step 2: Shape Analysis (ICP + SPHARM + PLS-DA)**
Double-click `run_everything.bat` or run it from the command line:
```bash
run_everything.bat
```

For an already completed ICP run, use the same production SPHARM command for either hemisphere:

```bat
SPHARM\run_spharm.bat left
SPHARM\run_spharm.bat right
```

Both commands use the shared batch implementation and validation settings; only the aligned input folder and the corresponding left/right SPHARM template differ.
The frozen production values are recorded in `SPHARM/standard_production_config.json` so a rerun can be audited against the same contract.

To verify both hemispheres under the same artifact contract:

```bat
"C:\Program Files\SlicerSALT 6.0.0\bin\PythonSlicer.exe" SPHARM\verify_bilateral_outputs.py ^
  --left_input_dir ICP\output_left_hippocampus\aligned_nifti ^
  --left_output_dir ICP\output_left_hippocampus ^
  --right_input_dir ICP\output_right_hippocampus\aligned_nifti ^
  --right_output_dir ICP\output_right_hippocampus ^
  --report bilateral_spharm_verification.json ^
  --deep
```
The bilateral verifier compares side-independent subject IDs (so `left_..._lh` and `right_..._rh` are paired correctly), reports side-specific label differences separately, and exits nonzero when any required SPHARM artifact is missing.
Feature extraction also requires each coefficient to have its `<subject>_processing.json` provenance contract; missing provenance is rejected.

To create the flat dataset folders used by the Desktop App from the current
SPHARM results, run this copy-only command from the project root:

```bat
"C:\Program Files\SlicerSALT 6.0.0\bin\PythonSlicer.exe" SPHARM\split_current_dataset.py
```

It discovers the complete Subject IDs directly from the current
`ICP\output_left_hippocampus\spharm_results` and
`ICP\output_right_hippocampus\spharm_results` folders. It assigns each Subject
to one deterministic 80/20 split (seed `20260919`) and copies both available
hemispheres into that same split. This avoids placing one patient in train on
one side and test on the other. Existing files are never deleted. The current
manifest is written to `SPHARM\split_data\current_split_manifest.json`; check
artifact completeness with:

```bat
"C:\Program Files\SlicerSALT 6.0.0\bin\PythonSlicer.exe" SPHARM\verify_current_split.py
```

The completeness report is written to `SPHARM\split_data\current_split_completeness.json`.
The verifier exits nonzero when a Subject lacks one of the required SPHARM
artifacts, so failed SPHARM jobs cannot be mistaken for a complete training
set.

To materialize the dataset-specific train/test folders from that same
patient-level assignment, run:

```bat
"C:\Program Files\SlicerSALT 6.0.0\bin\PythonSlicer.exe" SPHARM\create_dataset_train_test.py
```

This creates `Ds004469_Left`, `Ds004469_Right`, `Ds005602_Left`, and
`Ds005602_Right`, each with `train` and `test` folders plus a `status.csv`.
The summary is stored in `SPHARM\split_data\dataset_train_test_manifest.json`.

A folder-picker will prompt you to select the directory containing your extracted hippocampi (e.g., the `left_hippocampus` folder). SlicerSALT will launch headlessly and process the entire batch.

**Step 3: Machine Learning & Reporting**
Use [`RERUN_GUIDE_TH.md`](RERUN_GUIDE_TH.md) as the single current run guide. The
validated comparison run uses grouped 10-fold CV and Optuna, with the final command:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\Model\run_optuna_leakage_free_all.ps1 `
  --protocol all --cohort all --side all --model all --folds 10 --n_trials 10 `
  --tune_epochs 20 --tune_patience 5 --final_epochs 40 `
  --eval_seeds 42,123,2026 --device cuda --children_per_pair 8 `
  --noise_scale 0.02 --pls_components 8 `
  --output_root .\Model\optuna_runs_10fold_all
```

## 🔬 Scientific Context
This project leverages structural MRI to quantify **Hippocampal Sclerosis**, the most common neuropathological finding in Drug-Resistant Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. By moving beyond simple volumetric measurements (measuring just the size/volume) and utilizing SPHARM-PDM, we can localize exactly *where* on the surface the atrophy is occurring, providing a much higher diagnostic yield and offering powerful predictive features for machine learning pipelines.
